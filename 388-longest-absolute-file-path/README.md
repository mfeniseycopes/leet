# 388. Longest Absolute File Path

Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:
The name of a file contains at least a . and an extension.
The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a ..
Time complexity required: O(n) where n is the size of the input string.

Notice that `a/aa/aaa/file1.txt` is not the longest file path, if there is another path `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png`.

## Solution

So, computer file structures are generally defined as trees, so my initial intuition was to construct a tree as I parsed the input string. Seeing that the depth could bounce back up in the tree, I would need to provide parent pointers and basically run a traversal with each node maintaining the total length including itself. But these run at O(nlogn) and the description requires O(n).

### Stack!

To get around this excessive traversing, I decided upon building a stack, with each level representing a nested folder and maintaining its total length and depth. Whenever a file is encountered (those with a '.') it is not pushed to the stack, but the total length is checked against the max length.

When the depth changes, the stack is repeatedly popped until the parent folder depth is one less than the current folder.
